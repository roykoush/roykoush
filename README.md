# Hi, I'm Roy

I explore things.  
Mostly code, sometimes not.

This GitHub is where ideas turn into small experiments —  

There’s no single direction here,  
but if something seems odd, it probably has a reason.

### Recent interests:
- entropy from human inputs  
- randomness and simulation  
- quantum-like behavior in simple systems  
- secure password generation  
- minimal cryptography experiments

Most projects are small.  
Some may grow.  
All are built from scratch.

Thanks for visiting.
